## **Summary**

As a public service professional with over four years of experience in the federal government, I specialize in data processing, program integrity, and analytical reporting. My work with Employment and Social Development Canada has strengthened my ability to manage complex data, communicate effectively with diverse stakeholders, and ensure accuracy in information-driven decision making.

I recently completed the **Key Capabilities in Data Science Certificate** from the **University of British Columbia**, where I developed technical skills in **Python programming, data visualization, and applied analytics**. My career goal is to apply these data science skills to drive evidence-based innovation in government programs and services.
