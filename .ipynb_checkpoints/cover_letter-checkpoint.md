# About Me

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!

As a motivated public service professional with over four years of progressive experience in federal government roles, I have built a strong foundation in data processing, program integrity, and analytical reporting. My work with Employment and Social Development Canada has strengthened my ability to manage sensitive information, communicate effectively with diverse stakeholders, and ensure that complex workflows run efficiently and accurately.

Recently, I completed the Key Capabilities in Data Science Certificate through the University of British Columbia, where I developed skills in Python programming, data visualization, and applied analytics. This program deepened my passion for leveraging data to support evidence-based decision-making and program improvement within the public sector. I am particularly interested in how data storytelling and visualization can make complex information more accessible and actionable for policy and operational teams.

Combining my background in public administration with my growing technical expertise, I am eager to contribute to a more innovative, data-informed public service. I take pride in bringing both analytical rigor and a collaborative mindset to every project, with the goal of transforming information into insights that help government programs better serve Canadians.
